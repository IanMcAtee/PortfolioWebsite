    <h1>About Ian McAtee</h1>
    <p>
        Hi there, I’m Ian, It’s nice to meet you. After spending the better part of the last decade in healthcare, I’ve decided to make the transition into the engineering field. 
        While my time in healthcare has been incredibly rewarding, I’m excited to start a new role that merges that experience with my engineering education.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’ve seen firsthand how important tech is in improving patient care and making healthcare systems run effectively. 
        That’s why I’m excited about this transition—I want to help create the innovative tools that can make a real difference in people’s lives.
    </p>
    <p>
        While earning both a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in electrical engineering, I had the opportunity to explore many of the common technologies used in medicine and some that have the potential to revolutionize the field. 
        Of which, I’m most excited about mixed reality and machine learning. 
    </p>
    <p>
        After working with mixed reality, I quickly began to see its possible applications in healthcare. 
        Specifically, I’m fascinated by its potential to be a new modality in which to view medical imaging and data. 
        I can envision a world where surgeons are guided by holographic overlays of the patient’s preoperative scans. 
        Or one in which physicians and patients can discuss pathologies and treatment plans while both viewing a 3D reconstruction of the relevant anatomy. 
        These possibilities are but a few of the myriad that could transform how we care for patients.

        Nowadays, it seems impossible to get away from the tech buzzword that is AI. However, seeing beyond the hype, it is clear that machine learning will play a crucial role in the healthcare systems of the future. 
        From discovering new drug therapies, to predicting health trends, AI’s ability to model massive datasets will undoubtedly lead to novel medical applications. 
        While my studies have given me a basic understanding of machine learning, I’m interested to learn more so I can be a part of this new wave of healthcare technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        My overarching goal is to blend my healthcare experience with my engineering skills to build solutions that make healthcare more efficient, accessible, and high-quality. 
        I believe that by bridging the gap between medical professionals and tech developers, we can create amazing things.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my spare time, I like to take advantage of the Wyoming wilderness. 
        Whether that be hiking in the summer or skiing in the winter, I try to make time to get away from my computer. 
        I also enjoy learning about new tech and working on personal projects, which you can read about on my blog.
    </p>
    <p>
        I’m excited about this new journey and can’t wait to see where it takes me.
